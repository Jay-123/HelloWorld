      <h2>Why I'm Here</h2>
      <p> I have made a website on the internet to
        test my programming skills. I hope with future 
        updates that my website will improve in quality.
        As I learn more, my website will improve.
      </p>
      <h2>The Reason for the Website</h2>
      <p> I created this as a project for my school,
        but I want to make it much more than a project.
        I have hopes to make it functional and public with 
        its own domain.
      </p>
        <h2>More Facts</h2>
          <p> I like to learn and inspire others and I'll try to do
            that through the website I made. I have a mild interest
            to craft stuff in real life. I also aspire to learn some
            more skills of trade. This could include welding and wood
            work as well as many other variations of those skills. It
            would also explain my love for crafting games. I have some 
            more information on my <a href="about-me.html" >About Me</a>
            page that I will not try to repeat on this page. If you like
            what you see then stick around to see the page improve as 
            attemps of updating will happen. This includes the adding 
            of more content about myself and what my goals are. 
            <br>
              This is a project for something my school calls Winterim.
            Winterim lasts for a month and gives us a chance of learning
            a skill that doesn't come with normal academecs. which is a 
            cool opertunity that doesn't come commenly. It's a chance that
            my school gives that most if not all of the students are willing 
            to take. This Winterim I have taken the challenge of coding and 
            building a website. so far I have done mvp's (minnimal viable 
            product) for html and css to the best of my ability. I'm now 
            in the process of adding more information about me and where
            I come from. 
          </p>
        <h2>Where I Store Code</h2>
          <p> Storing code is helpful for many things.
            For instance you can access different file you
            could get ideas from. It's also useful to look at
            previous files to see how far you've come.
          </p>
          <p> I create code as well as store it. What I use to create 
            code is a handy application called VS code. VS stands for 
            visual studio and it's what I've been using for the duration
            of Winterim to make the website you see now.
          </p>

          <p> This website is a very useful to if you are
            at all interested in coding website. It will allow
            you to upload files to the site and keep them in a personal
            libary for people to look up and study. I could give them ideas
            for code or spark creativity.<br>
            If you have a github account than you 
            could see how I made this website (if at all interested). My 
            username is-
            Jay_123.
