         <p> I'm a simple guy of the age of 14, that 
          lives in utah, and wants to be good at coding. 
          I hope to improve and tell you about myself.
          I like were I live and take in the places
          with pride. My school is Karl .G Maeser
          prepatory academy which is a really good 
          school in my opinion.
          </p>
          <p> First off, I aspire to be a programmer hence 
          why I'm here. I also hope to aquire many other
          skills that help me learn more as a person, and
          I am personaly interested in. These are some of 
          the things about myself I want to improve. An
          idea on how to acoplish these goals is within 
          my schools mission statement.
          </p>
        <h2>Personal Time</h2>
          <p>Hobbies I like can be stuff along the lines of
          gaming, coding, and Youtube. These are things I 
          like to do if I have extra time on my hands.

        <h2>Where I Learned</h2>
          <p>I'm still learning from places, people, and google.
          It gives me helpful insite on how to refine and revise my
          code. It helps me inprove and memorize different commands
          so My code is cleaner. Some of the places I like to learn 
          are code academy, w3 schools, and from friends
