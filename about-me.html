         <p> I'm a simple guy of the age of 14. I live
          in Utah, and want to be good at coding. 
          I hope to improve and tell you about myself.
          I like were I live, and take in the places
          with pride. My school is Karl G. Maeser
          Preparatory Academy which is a really good 
          school in my opinion.
          </p>
          <p> First off, I aspire to be a programmer hence 
          why I'm here. I also hope to aquire many other
          skills that help me learn more as a person, and
          what I am personaly interested in. These are 
          some of the things about myself I want to improve. 
          An idea on how to accomplish these goals is within 
          my schools mission statement.
